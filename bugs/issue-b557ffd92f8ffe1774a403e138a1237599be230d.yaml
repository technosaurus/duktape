title: allow writing single character values to buffer objects (e.g. buf[123] = 'x')
desc: |-
  Currently the string value will be coerced to a number which leads to
  quite unexpected behavior.  For instance, buf[123] = 'x' will assign 0x00
  to the buffer, and buf[123] = '9' will assign 0x09 (not 0x39) to the buffer.

    Taking the byte value of the first byte of a string would actually work quite
    well.  Because strings are guaranteed to have NUL terminator, empty strings
    would cause a zero to be written which is reasonably intuitive.  For non-ASCII
    characters the first byte of the extended UTF-8 representation would be used:
    not great (better might be codepoint & 0xff) but probably good enough.
