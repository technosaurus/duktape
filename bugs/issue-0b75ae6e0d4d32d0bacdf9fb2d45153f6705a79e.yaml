title: "turboc: spurious duplicate symbol/label errors (32 char max)"
desc: |-
  TurboC compares only 32 characters from the beginning of symbol/define names.
  If symbols are different but share the same 32 character prefix, they're
  confused to be the same symbol.  This causes a set of errors.
  
  The 32 character limit might be a good guideline in general.  Some symbols
  are currently a bit long and tedious even when the compiler supports them.
