title: finish Unicode case conversion support
desc: |-
  There is currently no way to set the current locale/language, which affects
  e.g. case conversion.  For instance, the lowercase conversion of U+0307 is
  language specific, while the lowercase conversion of U+03A3 is context (but
  not language) specific.  Add a mechanism for setting these, and add test cases
  to cover the different cases.

  - "Apparently String case conversions (toLowerCase() and toUpperCase()) should\n\
    normally NOT use locale/language information.  Locale-specific case conversions\n\
    (toLocaleLowerCase() and toLocaleUpperCase()) should use locale information;\n\
    see for instance E5.1 Section 15.5.4.17:\n\n  \"This function works exactly the same as toLowerCase except that its result\n  is intended to yield the correct result for the host environment\xE2\x80\x98s current\n  locale, rather than a locale-independent result. There will only be a\n  difference in the few cases (such as Turkish) where the rules for that\n  language conflict with the regular Unicode case mappings.\"\n\n\
    The current implementation has a single case conversion helper with no support\n\
    for locale/language or indicating whether locale/language specific rules\n\
    should be obeyed.  This must be changed so that caller can indicate what to\n\
    do with respect to locales.  String functions like toLowerCase() and\n\
    toLocaleLowerCase() must use the appropriate flags."
