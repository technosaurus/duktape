title: resolve gcc signed overflow warnings from matrix testing (-O3 or above)
desc: |-
  The error (warning, promoted to error by -Werror)::
  
      error: assuming signed overflow does not occur when assuming that (X - c) > X is always false
  
  https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FAQ#signed_overflow
  https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-33314
  
  See if the call sites exhibiting this can be fixed - if not, document that -fno-strict-overflow
  is recommended.
