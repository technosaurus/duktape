title: gcc -pedantic without -std=c99 causes 'unsigned long long' to be used and an associated warning for it
desc: |-
  The type is available and it is autodetected based on ULLONG_MAX and friends,
  but the compiler will still warn about it.  Should we not use the type?  There
  is no reasonable way to know that the compiler will warn about a type it *does*
  support - other than special casing for the compiler.
