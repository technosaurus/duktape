title: "softint: enable if soft fp in use"
desc: |-
  Enable FASTINT support automatically when soft floating points are in use
  and other requirements are met.
  
  Soft FP usage can be detected e.g. with __SOFTFP__ on GCC.  It's critical
  to detect that actual soft FP library calls are being generated by the
  compiler - not that soft floats are supported, or that a soft float ABI is
  being used.
  
  The user should then have two defines to force FASTINT one way or another:
  
  * DUK_OPT_FASTINT48: force fastint into use
  
  * DUK_OPT_NO_FASTINT48: disable fastints forcibly
  
  Both yes/no flags are needed if Duktape defaults based on the environment.
