title: rewrite matrix testing hack to be more useful
desc: |-
  Allow exhaustive runs as well as sampled runs.  Allow parallelism.
  
  In addition to a fixed testcase, allow a random testcase to be executed.
  This allows random sampling of compile options + testcases, which would
  otherwise be a space far too large.
