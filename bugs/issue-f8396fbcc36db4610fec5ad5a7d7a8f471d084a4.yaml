title: reimplement RegExp "source" property as an accessor
desc: |-
  The RegExp source could be appended to the RegExp bytecode to reduce
  memory churn - RegExp bytecodes and sources are rarely very large, so
  this wouldn't create large memory allocations.
  
  This would reduce the RegExp instance property count by one, and make
  RegExp.prototype.compile() polyfill easier to implement.
