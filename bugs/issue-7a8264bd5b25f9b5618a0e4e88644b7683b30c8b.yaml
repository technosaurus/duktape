title: "api: clean up duk_{put,get,del,has}_var() API calls"
desc: |-
  These API calls are not yet in use.  They'll become more relevant with
  introspection (required by e.g. debugging), in which case the API calls
  may be introspecting either Ecmascript or Duktape/C activations.
  
  A few notes from earlier API design:
  
  - duk_put_var(): There could be a return value indicating whether the put failed
    This is not relevant in strict mode, but in non-strict mode a variable put can
    silently fail.
  
  - duk_get_var(): Although Ecmascript semantics always require a ReferenceError for
    unresolvable identifiers, it might fit the API better to return zero if
    identifier is not found and non-zero if found.  This would match the property
    access API.
