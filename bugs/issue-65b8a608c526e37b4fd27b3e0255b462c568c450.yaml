title: global code 'this' binding is undefined when global code is strict
desc: |-
  Currently the caller is expected to provide the proper binding, and the
  call handling then coerces the 'this' binding is it would for a function.
  
  In the non-strict case this yields the correct result even if the caller
  misbehaves and provides a null/undefined as the this binding (perhaps the
  calling code uses duk_call() instead of duk_call_method(), for instance,
  like duk_cmdline.c used to do).
  
  In the strict case the 'undefined' value stands and causes various problems.
  There is no problem if the caller uses duk_call_method() and pushes the
  global object as the 'this' binding, and this is actually as designed.
  
  But perhaps this is unnecessarily brittle, and global/eval code should get
  their 'this' binding disregarding the 'this' binding provided on the
  value stack?
