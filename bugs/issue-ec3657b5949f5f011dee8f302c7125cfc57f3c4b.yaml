title: fix handling of array .length larger than 0xffffffffUL
desc: |-
  In some corner cases the spec requires that array 'length' be set to a value
  larger than 2^32-1.  This breaks some assumptions in e.g. duk_hobject_props.c.
  
  The cleanest fix would probably be to refuse setting 'length' to such a value,
  i.e. to reject operations that would do so in duk_bi_array.c.  This is not
  compliant but better than an incorrect assert in duk_hobject_props.c (where
  the code assumes that array 'length' fits into a duk_uint32_t).
