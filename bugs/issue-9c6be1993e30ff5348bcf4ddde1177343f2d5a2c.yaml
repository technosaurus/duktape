    Work branch is api-default-strictness.
    
    The trivial approach has the drawback that C code can no longer eval or compile
    anything non-strict.  This could be mitigated with additional flags, but this is
    less trivial than seems at first.

  - Now that eval strictness handling was changed this should be more feasible again.
