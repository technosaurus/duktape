title: "API: remove duk_is_strict_call() from the public API"
desc: |-
  The duk_is_strict_call() now always returns 1 because in Duktape 0.12.0
  all Duktape API contexts are considered strict.  This is *not* the case
  for Duktape internally when an Ecmascript function is running, so the
  duk_is_strict_call() is still necessary -- it could just be removed from
  the public API.

    Keep the function, it might be possible to have lenient user functions at some
    point, and debugger functionality may need it.
