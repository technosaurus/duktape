title: readthedocs.org versions of documentation?
desc: |-
  Readthedocs.org has a nice browser outline and nice RST formatting.
  
  The internal documentation is almost directly usable in Readthedocs.
  
  The Guide and API documentation would need a new builder which would
  generate RST instead of HTML.  This is easy for API docs which are in
  a custom format anyway, but existing HTML documentation will be an
  issue.
