desc: |-
  Also go through test cases to find common helpers and make utils out of

    The include mechanism should probably be the module mechanism.  This would
    make test cases still runnable from command line as long as there is a
    compatible module mechanism.

    Ecma-262 has a model where a testcase is "prepped".
    
    This might work quite well also for Duktape testcases.  Test cases which
    are "raw" and test for basic parsing of functions etc don't need the same
    prepping, but this can prevented in test case metadata.
