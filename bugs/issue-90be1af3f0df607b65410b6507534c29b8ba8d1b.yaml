title: "Proxy: prototype walk semantics"
desc: |-
  The Proxy [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal method resumes prototype walk
  from [[ProxyTarget]] if no getPrototypeOf trap exists.  We don't
  support getPrototypeOf trap now; internal prototype walks don't have
  the [[GetPrototypeOf]] behavior and the walks will operate on the proxy
  instead.
  
  This is incorrect and will lead to some incorrect results - such as
  instanceof working poorly.
  
  Fixing this requires that all prototype walks in Duktape must take
  proxies into account.
