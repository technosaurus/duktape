title: migrate detailed compile options from guide to RST documentation
desc: |-
  There are quite a lot of options which makes compilation seem unnecessarily
  complex because a user doesn't usually need any options.
  
  Migrate the long, complete options list to `doc/feature-options.rst` or
  `doc/compiling.txt`.  Keep only a few central options in the guide, and
  refer to the internal doc for the rest.
