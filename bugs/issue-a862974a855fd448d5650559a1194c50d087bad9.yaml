title: optimized 'iswhole' primitive
desc: |-
  To support the FASTINT branch, there needs to be an optimized primitive
  for checking whether a number is a whole number which be represented with
  N bits (e.g. signed 48 bits).
  
  For the FASTINT branch, a quick reject is not useful, as numbers are
  usually expected to be integers.  A quick accept is useful if that is at
  all possible.
  
  In any case, the DUK_SET_TVAL_NUMBER() handler should have a fast inlined
  version because the check is made by default for all numbers where FASTINT
  fast paths are not explicitly implemented.
