title: "api: add the ability to give an initial size for array/object pushed on stack"
desc: |-
  It would be useful to allow caller to specify initial size for a pushed
  array or object, so that object initialization code can allocate enough
  space to fit any properties the caller is immediately going to init.
  This reduces memory churn for all initialized objects, because currently
  objects always grow from zero size (in reasonable steps, though).
  
  This requires a small change to the object resizing algorithm.  Perhaps
  an object needs a flag to indicate that it shouldn't be made smaller
  than its current size, until it is grown for the first time (?)
