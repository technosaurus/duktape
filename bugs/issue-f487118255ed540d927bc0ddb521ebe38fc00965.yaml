title: "raw property api: allow property editing to override attributes"
desc: |-
  C code is trusted anyway so it would be nice if there was enough API
  functionality to allow C code to bypass Ecmascript configurability
  restrictions.  This allows C code to make e.g. sandboxing changes even
  for properties that are non-configurable etc.
