title: add Ecmascript and/or C API to actually delete a finalizer reference
desc: |-
  Currently there is no way to delete the internal _finalizer property.  You can
  set it to undefined with Duktape.fin() or duk_set_finalizer() which makes the
  object behave like it has no finalizer, but the object will retain the property
  slot unnecessarily.
  
  This could be fixed by special casing null/undefined (or any non-function
  value) when setting a finalizer, or by adding a separate API call to do that
  (this seems clunky and unnecessary for a corner case).
  
  If the finalizer reference is made a documented internal property, there will
  be no need for explicit API calls and ordinary propert get/set/delete
  primitives could be used.
