title: dukweb eval output for Duktape.info(Duktape) does not show pointer or 'null' in its place
desc: |-
  Currently the output is encoded with JSON.stringify() which produces a 'null'
  in place of the pointer (this is visible in the console.log).  However, the
  value which ends up in the browser output area is empty (e.g. 3,,7,.. instead
  of 3,0xdeadbeef,7,...).
  
  This will probably resolve automatically when a better value passing mechanism
  is implemented.
