title: support for a 64-bit signed/unsigned plain type
desc: |-
  Some API bindings would benefit from being able to pass around 64-bit
  signed and unsigned values without precision loss.
  
  Ideally such a type would probably be a different type from C perspective
  but behave like a number from Ecmascript perspective (similarly to how
  lightfuncs work).
  
  The basic problem is that it can't fit into an 8-byte tval so it would
  need to be heap allocated at least with 8-byte tvals.
