title: rework duk_put_function_list() to use a hidden struct format and initializer macros
desc: |-
  This would allow the underlying struct entries to be expanded and new
  macros to be introduced (e.g. variant for lightfuncs) without breaking
  source compatibility.
  
  Right now duk_put_function_list() cannot be extended to support e.g. lightfuncs.
  The fact that it exposes the struct contents makes it difficult to extend.
