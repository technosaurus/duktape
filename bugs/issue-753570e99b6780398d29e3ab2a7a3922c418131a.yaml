title: "api: reconsider duk_get_length() return value behavior for objects"
desc: |-
  Currently the returned value is a 32-bit one, although the function's return
  type is duk_size_t.
  
  Comment from API design phase:
  
  - Handling of object length is a bit curious as it is not clamped or
    checked against the size_t range.  The 32-bit unsigned range comes
    from the fact that Ecmascript semantics for array lengths are defined
    for 32-bit unsigned integer lengths (E5).
