title: clean up value stack reserve + extra handling
desc: |-
  Currently there are only internal constants for value stack reservation.
  The duktape.h header should expose at least the reserve that a user can
  expect to have upon function entry.
  
  Also, currently on entry to a Duktape/C function only DUK_VALSTACK_INTERNAL_EXTRA
  value stack reserve is automatically allocated.  If this constant is really
  for internal use only, there is actually no user reservation by default.
  This should be fixed by adding the user reserve to the value stack check
  at least when entering a Duktape/C function (this isn't necessary for
  Ecmascript functions).
