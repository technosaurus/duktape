title: "API: remove return value of duk_del_prop() and duk_put_prop()"
desc: |-
  They are now irrelevant for user code at least.  Not for Duktape internally,
  so perhaps an API macro could cast the unnecessary return value to void?

    Keep the return code: it might be possible to have lenient user functions at
    some point.
