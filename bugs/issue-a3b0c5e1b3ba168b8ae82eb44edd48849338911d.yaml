title: add a few buffer manipulation primitives accessible from Ecmascript code
desc: |-
  Although buffers are mostly meant to be operated on from C code, there should
  at least be primitives to extract a sub-buffer (or copy it fully) and copy data
  from one buffer to another.
  
  There will be more bindings with higher level buffer abstractions so this should
  now be kept to a minimum.
