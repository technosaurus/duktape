title: add 16-bit magic value to plain buffer and pointer objects
desc: |-
  There's 16 bits of space in duk_tval for all pointer-based values.  A magic
  value could be used by the caller for instance to validate pointers at run
  time to avoid segfaults.
  
  Both pointers and buffers could benefit from a magic value.
