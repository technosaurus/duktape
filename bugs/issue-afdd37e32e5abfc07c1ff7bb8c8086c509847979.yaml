title: document version compatibility expectations
desc: |-
  Most important is expectations for a maintained release (like 1.0), such as
  backporting of fixes (what kind?) and features (what kind?).
  
  API change compatibility: outline the basic expectation that APIs will either
  remain compatible or be removed entirely so that compile fails reliably.  Same
  for feature options.
