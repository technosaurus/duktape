title: "recheck valstack policy for elements above top: garbage or UNUSED?"
desc: |-
  Currently the elements are carefully kept as UNDEFINED_UNUSED, whereas in
  other contents elements outside GC reachability are considered garbage.
  
  Would it be better to allow elements above value stack top to be garbage
  instead?  It would mean making it more costly to increase stack top, but
  less costly to decrease it.
