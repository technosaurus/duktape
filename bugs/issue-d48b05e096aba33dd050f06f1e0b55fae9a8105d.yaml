title: add a duk_def_prop() variant with 'length' special behavior, would be useful for Array built-ins
desc: |-
  Array built-ins now need to set elements with raw duk_def_prop() calls, keep
  track of desired result 'length' manually, and finally set the result 'length'
  explicitly with a duk_def_prop() call.
  
  This is nice in that no special behaviors are invoked while iterating a
  potentially large number of elements, but it's a bit awkward to keep track
  of the desired length every step of the way.
  
  Another approach would be to have a duk_def_prop() variant with array
  'length' special handling.  This would at least be an option in the built-in
  code: faster primitives would keep track of 'length' manually, slower ones
  would use the duk_def_prop() variant with special 'length' handling.
