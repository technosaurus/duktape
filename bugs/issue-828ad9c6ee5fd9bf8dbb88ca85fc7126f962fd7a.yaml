title: "api: minor cleanups to api_{get,put,has,del}_prop() API calls"
desc: |-
  Cleanup property API documentation and return value behavior.
  
  * duk_del_prop() and duk_put_prop(): Return value is now pointless when Duktape API calls are strict.
  
  * duk_get_prop(): Guarantee '1' instead of non-zero for return value?
  
  A counter-argument for keeping the return values is that perhaps the strictness
  behavior will change at some point and will again be useful.  Another case might
  be a debugger interface, where the debugger can interact with properties using
  this API, even when the current activation is an Ecmascript one.
