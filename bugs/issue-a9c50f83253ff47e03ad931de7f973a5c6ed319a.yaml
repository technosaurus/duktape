title: remove 64-bit type detection altogether for non-C99 and non-major compilers?
desc: |-
  64-bit detection is a major hassle:
  
  * Even if the compiler supports 64-bit types and provides defines for it,
    it might not support the *format* of those defines itself.  For instance,
    the compiler may define ULLONG_MAX but when you use it, it may generate
    warnings.
  
  * Similarly, the compiler may support a type (e.g. unsigned long long) but
    will warn if you use it.
  
  It's next to impossible to do warning-free detection and usage of these
  types.
  
  Perhaps the cleanest approach is to use 64-bit arithmetic only on C99/C++11
  platforms and on specific compilers where the support is known to exist.
  This would remove the need for 64-bit detection and avoid 64-bit types
  when they cannot be reliably detected/used.
