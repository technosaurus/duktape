title: duk_peval_file() throws an error if target file is missing
desc: |-
  Caused by macro implementation, which uses duk_push_file_string() to push file
  contents on stack.  The duk_push_file_string() call is not protected and throws
  if file is missing.
  
  One fix would be to add an internal duk_push_file_string() variant which pushed
  undefined to stack if file is missing.  The eval call can then fail due to
  missing argument.
