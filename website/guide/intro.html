<h2>Document scope</h2>

<p>This guide provides an introduction to using Duktape in your programs.
Once you're familiar with the basics, there is a concise
<a href="api.html">API reference</a> for looking up API details.</p>

<p>This document doesn't cover Duktape internals (see the
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/tree/master/doc">Duktape repo</a>
if you wish to tinker with them).</p>

<h2>What is Duktape?</h2>

<p>Duktape is an embeddable Ecmascript E5/E5.1 engine with a focus
on portability and compact footprint.  By integrating Duktape into your
C/C++ program you can easily extend its functionality through scripting.
You can also build the main control flow of your program in Ecmascript
and use fast C code functions to do heavy lifting.</p>

<p>The terms Ecmascript and Javascript are often considered more or less
equivalent, although Javascript and its variants are technically just one
environment where the Ecmascript language is used.  The line between the
two is not very clear in practice: even non-browser Ecmascript environments
often provide some browser-specific built-ins.  Duktape is no exception,
and provides the commonly used <code>print()</code> and <code>alert()</code>
built-ins.  Even so, we use the term Ecmascript throughout to refer to the
language implemented by Duktape.</p>

<h2>Conformance</h2>

<p>Duktape conforms to the following Ecmascript specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262%205th%20edition%20December%202009.pdf">Edition 5 (E5)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf">Edition 5.1 (E5.1)</a>
    (as <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/">HTML</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The upcoming Ecmascript Edition 6 standard is not yet final.  Duktape borrows
<a href="#es6features">a few features</a> from the E6 draft:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html">Edition 6 (E6) draft</a> (Rev 24, April 27, 2014)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Besides standard Ecmascript features, Duktape has the following additional
features (some are visible to applications, while others are internal):</p>
<ul>
<li>Borrowed from ES6: <code>setPrototypeOf</code>/<code>__proto__</code>
    and a subset of <code>Proxy</code> objects</li>
<li>Borrowed from browsers: <code>print()</code> and <code>alert()</code></li>
<li>Duktape specific built-ins: provided by the <code>Duktape</code> global object</li>
<li>Extended types: custom "buffer" and "pointer" types, extended string type
    which supports arbitary binary strings and
    non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane">BMP</a>
    strings (standard Ecmascript only supports 16-bit codepoints)</li>
<li>Combined reference counting and mark-and-sweep garbage collection,
    with finalizers and emergency garbage collection (you can also build
    with just reference counting or mark-and-sweep)</li>
<li>Coroutine support</li>
<li>Tail call support</li>
<li>Built-in debugger</li>
<li>Built-in CommonJS-based module loading framework</li>
<li>Built-in regular expression engine with no platform dependencies</li>
<li>Built-in Unicode support with no platform dependencies</li>
<li>Built-in number parsing and formatting with no platform dependencies</li>
<li>Additional custom JSON formats (JX and JC)</li>
<li>Very lightweight built-in logging framework available for both C and
    Ecmascript code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p><b>Compliance</b>.  Ecmascript E5/E5.1 and real world compliance.
Ecmascript compliance requires regular expression and Unicode support.
When possible, implement features from the upcoming Ecmascript E6
specification to minimize Duktape custom features.</p>

<p><b>Portability</b>.  Minimal system dependencies are nice when porting,
so Duktape depends on very few system libraries.  For example, number
formatting and parsing, regular expressions, and Unicode are all implemented
internally by Duktape.  One of the few dependencies that cannot be fully
eliminated is system date/time integration.  This is confined to the
implementation of the <code>Date</code> built-in.</p>

<p><b>Easy C interface</b>.  The interface between Duktape and C programs
should be natural and error-tolerant.  As a particular issue, string
representation should be UTF-8 with automatic NUL terminators to match
common C use.</p>

<p><b>Small footprint</b>.  Code and data footprint should be as small as
possible, even for small programs.  This is more important than performance,
as there are already several very fast engines but fewer very compact,
portable engines.</p>

<p><b>Reasonable performance</b>.  Small footprint (and portability, to some
extent) probably eliminates the possibility of a competitive JIT-based engine,
so there is no practical way of competing with very advanced JIT-based engines
like SpiderMonkey (and its optimized variants) or Google V8.  Performance
should still be reasonable for typical embedded programs.
<a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> is a good benchmark in this respect.
(Adding optional, modular support for JITing or perhaps off-line compilation
would be nice.)</p>

<p><b>ASCII string performance</b>.  It's important that operations dealing
with plain ASCII strings be very fast: ASCII dominates most embedded use.
Operations dealing with non-ASCII strings need to perform reasonably but are
not critical.  This is a necessary trade-off: using C-compatible strings means
essentially using UTF-8 string representation which makes string indexing and
many other operations slower than with fixed size character representations.
It's still important to support common idioms like iterating strings sequentially
(in either direction) efficiently.</p>
