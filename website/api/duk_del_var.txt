[ ... varname! ] -> [ ... ]

=summary
XXX

<p>The identifier deletion is equivalent to the Ecmascript expression:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
delete varname
</pre>

<div class="note">
Attempt to delete an identifier is compile time SyntaxError in strict mode
code.  Because Duktape/C functions run in strict mode, the semantics for this
call are currently not very useful when called from inside a Duktape/C function.
